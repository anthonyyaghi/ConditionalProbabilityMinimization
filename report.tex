% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:

% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.

\section{Introduction}
The field of reliability study started to take shape during the second world
war. A lot of new military equipments were introduced and the main appplication
of reliability was focused on the vaccum tube which was an integral part of many
of these equipements, like radar systems. And so, the military needed a
measurement of how likely these costly equipements were to fails in order to
mitigate the risk of a malfunction during the war. Today, reliability study
is a large field with both military and commercial applications.\\


\section{Conclusion}
The conclusion goes here.
